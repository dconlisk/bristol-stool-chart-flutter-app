#### Overview

Type six poops are mushy stools. They can indicate diarrhoea due to bacterial or viral infection. However, there are many causes of diarrhoea. You may just have eaten something that didn't agree with you, or you may be quite sick. Stools at the loose or liquid end of the spectrum may pass through the system too quickly. You may experience an urgency to poop, or even in some cases have an "accident".

#### Information

Take plenty of liquids to counter the dehydration. Rehydration salts can be helpful to restore lost electrolytes. Contact your health professional if it continues.
