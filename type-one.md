#### Overview

A type one poop on the chart represents impacted faeces. Type 1 stools have spent the longest amount of time in the colon of any of the types on the chart. When faeces sit in the colon for too long, it can cause one to become constipated. Causes can include the side effects of medications (such as antibiotics, diuretics, antipsychotics and antacids). It means that the stool has a low water content, and it is probably hard to pass. It may be scratchy and may cause irritation or damage to the anal passage.

#### Information

This type of poop represents constipation. If you are taking new medication consult the doctor who prescribed it. Try to drink more water and increase the fibre content of your diet. Take more exercise: bowel movements are facilitated by walking. Stress can be alleviated by exercise. Type 1 stools may be a sign of constipation, so it may be worth checking your diet if this happens regularly. Talk to your health professional if you are regularly experiencing type one poops.
