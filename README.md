# The Bristol Stool Chart mobile app written in Flutter
This is the third (turd?) iteration of the Bristol Stool Chart mobile app (from iOS native, to Xamarin Forms, and now to Flutter). It's a total rewrite with a new Material design and using Google Flutter and Dart. It's a single codebase that runs on both iOS and Android phones and tablets.

This app is used by medical professionals with their patients to track their stool quality over time. Users can track their stools and then share the data with their chosen health professional in the form of an easy-to-read graph as well as a csv of the raw data. The app does not track user data and is totally anonymous - no login required.

I created this app as a way to practice using flutter while also keeping the app current and up-to-date. It uses a bunch of flutter packages, as well as FontAwesome and the Syncfusion SfChart control.
