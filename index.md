## The Bristol Stool Chart

The Bristol Stool Chart is a well-known chart developed by Dr. Ken Heaton in Bristol, England and first published in 1997. It is designed to classify the various forms of human stools (poops) into seven categories (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Stool_Scale" target="_blank">see the Wikipedia article here</a>).

This mobile app brings the chart to your device. It allows you to quickly and easily scroll through the different stool types to rate your own stools. Your stool quality is then tracked over time in a simple to understand graph which can be sent via email to your health professional. The app also presents you with information about each type of stool along with links to more information online.

### How it works

Simply swipe through the stool types until you find the closest match. If you have enabled the blood stool check, then set the switch accordingly. Check that the date and time are correct and hit save.

The app creates a graph of your stool quality over time, with an explanation of what it means. You can share the graph with your chosen health professional from within the app.

Your data is always private. [Read our privacy policy](/privacy "Privacy").

### New feature! Track blood in your stools

This is a new feature available in the latest version of the app. Go to the Settings page in the app to enable a "Blood in stool?" switch which appears when you track your stools. This information is then included in your graph in the form of a red asterisk over those stools that had blood in them. 

## Friendly Support

Please visit the [Bristol Stool Chart support section](/support "Bristol Stool Scale Support") for any issues with your app. We are also happy to hear any feedback or ideas you may have for improving it.
