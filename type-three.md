#### Overview

A type three poop on the chart is a normal stool. If it requires some straining to pass, then a slightly softer stool form is preferable. But generally type 3 and type 4 on the scale are the most desirable stool forms.

#### Information

A type three poop is a normal and desirable stool so there is really nothing to worry about. However, in general it's good to try and drink more water, increase the fibre content of your diet, and take more exercise to counter stress and facilitate bowel movements. Keep up the good work!
