## The Bristol Stool Chart

The Bristol Stool Chart is a well-known chart developed by Dr. Ken Heaton in Bristol, England and first published in 1997. It is designed to classify the various forms of human stools (poops) into seven categories ([see the Wikipedia article here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Stool_Scale)).

This new mobile app brings the chart to your device. It allows you to quickly and easily scroll through the different stool types to rate your own poop. Your stool quality is then tracked over time in a simple to understand graph which can be sent via email to your health professional. The app also presents you with information about each type of stool along with links to more information online.

### How it works

Simply swipe through the stool types until you find the closest match. Check that the date and time are correct and hit save.

The app creates a graph of your stool quality over time, with an explanation of what it means. You can share the graph via email from within the app.
