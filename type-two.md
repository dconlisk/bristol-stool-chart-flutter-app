#### Overview

A type two poop on the chart can represent mild constipation. This could mean that you have moderately impacted faeces. The backing up of faecal matter in the body is one possible cause. A type two stool has a low water content. It indicates that transit time through the bowel is slow. This could be caused by stress or other factors.

#### Information

Try to drink more water and increase the fibre content of your diet. Take more exercise: bowel movements are facilitated by walking. Constipation can sometimes be stress-related, and stress can be alleviated by exercise. It may be worth talking to your health professional if this is happening regularly.
